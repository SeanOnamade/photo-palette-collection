                  <p>
                    I'm a story-lover at the core. Photography allowes me to capture light as a standalone story, leaving it to our imaginations to extrapolate, to explore the beauty inherent to every moment. My journey began freshman year of college, where I joined the school newspaper, and since then I've been fortunate enough to photography my friends, my family, and my beautiful surroundings.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    My approach is still developing; I tend to focus on on composition, framing, and color. As a writer on the side, I believe photography should tell a story and evoke feeling, not just document a moment (although the latter isn't bad either!).
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    When I'm not behind the camera, I enjoy writing, making music, hitting the gym, and hanging out with friends.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    My work has been featured in the Vanderbilt Hustler, various student organization events, and photo clubs, and I'm always looking for new challenges and collaborations that push my artistic boundaries.
