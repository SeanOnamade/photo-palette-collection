                    I am a photographer with a passion for capturing the authentic beauty in every moment. My journey began over a decade ago, and since then I've been fortunate to work with amazing clients across portrait, landscape, and commercial photography.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    My approach is minimalist and intentional, focusing on composition, lighting, and the genuine emotion of each scene. I believe photography should tell a story and evoke feeling, not just document a moment.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    When I'm not behind the camera, I enjoy hiking in nature, exploring urban landscapes, and studying the work of master photographers who inspire my creative vision.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    My work has been featured in several publications and exhibitions, and I'm always looking for new challenges and collaborations that push my artistic boundaries.
